This Privacy Policy aims to inform users about our practices regarding data collection, usage, and disclosure when using our application.

**Information Collection and Use**

Zapify does not require authentication or login. All phone numbers used within the app are stored locally on your device and can be deleted at any time. We do not collect or transmit personally identifiable information to external servers. However, the app uses third-party services for analytics, advertising, and performance improvements. These services may collect data as specified in their respective privacy policies:

- [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
- [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)
- [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)
- [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)
- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/privacy)

Zapify requests permission to access call history to provide users with a shortcut to initiate conversations with recent callers. This data is not transmitted externally and is used solely to enhance the user experience within the app.

**Log Data**

In case of an error in the app, we collect Log Data through third-party services. This may include information such as your device’s IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, time and date of use, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Zapify does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party services integrated into the app may use cookies to enhance their functionality. Users can choose to accept or refuse cookies through their device settings.

**Third-Party Services**

We may engage third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our service, perform service-related tasks, or analyze app usage. These third parties have access to certain user data strictly for the purpose of providing these services and are obligated not to disclose or misuse the information.

**Security**

We strive to implement commercially acceptable security measures to protect user data. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

Zapify may contain links to external websites. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we encourage users to review their respective privacy policies.

**Children’s Privacy**

Zapify is not intended for users under the age of 13. The app does not collect or store personal data from users. However, third-party services integrated into the app may process usage information for analytics and advertising purposes. If you are a guardian of a child who has used the app and have concerns about data collection by third parties, we recommend reviewing the privacy policies of the integrated services and adjusting device permissions accordingly.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Users are advised to review this page regularly. Any changes will be posted on this page, and continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Effective Date: 2025-02-22
